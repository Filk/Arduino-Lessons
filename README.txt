# Arduino-Sketches

This repository contains Arduino sketches and all the materials (e.g. pdf, fritzing projects) I use to teach Arduino and basic electronics.

Lesson 1.
What is Physical Computing about.
Basic concepts about electricity - voltage, amperage and resistance
First experiments

Lesson 2.
Explain: Arduino IDE, resistors, breadboard and jumper cables
Make: A blinking LED
Hacking stuff, DIY and Nicolas Collins

Lesson 3.
Explain: buttons, RGB Led, potenciometers and the code in the Arduino IDE
Make: make a blinking LED and use buttons to turn it on or off
Jamming
Show and tell: RGB clothing box and André Rangel (http://3kta.net/3projects.php)

Lesson 4.
Explain: PWM, LDR, dc motors, transistors, diodes and the Serial monitor in the IDE
Make: make a motor spin faster or slower according to the distance to the brightness
Jamming
Show and tell: Quadrature and Ars Electronica

Lesson 5.
Explain: Ultrasound sensor, servo motor and external libraries
Make: 	1) make a servo motor spin according to the distance to the ultrasound sensor
	2) control an mp3 player (DFrobot)
Show and tell: Robotic gamelan at Casa da Música and OrCA

Lesson 6.
